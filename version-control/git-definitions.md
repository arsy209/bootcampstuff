# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	A version control system is something every coder uses. It contains different repository files which are used as source codes for subfiles of computer programs. Any type of change that is made to the program would be documented such as who changed it, why the change was made and there were any type of new information or references added. Developers use version control because it is easier to keep track of all the past work or changes that were made and it would speed the process up with faster communications. People can copy the work that was already done and make changes to that file without having to affect the original one until it is committed into the master file.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	a branch is something that keeps track of putting different codes together that have a common base and it would affect the main control without commiting to it. You would used a branch to edit a code by either deleting or adding something to it. it can be copied and woul not affect the main file at all. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is known as a act of making permanent changes to a certain program. If someone edits it, there would be changes that would be made but it would not be put in affect until that person commits it to the master file. The best practices for committing a practice is that it should be less then 50 characters and have no period at the end. There should also be a space at the second line. 

* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict is caused when you would be either merging or pulling a branch from a file.
